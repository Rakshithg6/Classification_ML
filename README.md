# Classification_ML

## Overview
This repository contains code for implementing classification algorithms in machine learning. Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to categorize input data into one of several predefined classes or categories. This README provides an overview of classification, its algorithms, and instructions for usage.

## Algorithms
Several classification algorithms are commonly used in machine learning, including:

1. *Logistic Regression*: A linear model used for binary classification tasks, where the output is a probability score indicating the likelihood of the input belonging to one class.

2. *Decision Trees*: A tree-based model that recursively partitions the feature space into subsets, making decisions based on feature values to assign labels to instances.

3. *Random Forest*: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes as the prediction.

4. *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*: A discriminative classifier that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in feature space.

5. *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*: A non-parametric method that classifies new instances based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
   

## Usage
To utilize classification algorithms in your machine learning projects, follow these steps:

1. *Install Dependencies*: Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

2. *Prepare Data*: Ensure your dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Handle any missing values and encode categorical features if necessary.

3. *Choose Algorithm*: Select the classification algorithm(s) suitable for your dataset and problem domain. Consider factors such as interpretability, performance, and scalability.

4. *Train Model*: Train the chosen algorithm(s) on the training data using appropriate hyperparameters. Use techniques like cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

5. *Evaluate Model*: Evaluate the trained model(s) on the testing data using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC).

6. *Fine-tuning*: Optionally, fine-tune hyperparameters or explore different feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.

7. *Deployment*: Once satisfied with the performance, deploy the trained model for making predictions on new, unseen data.
